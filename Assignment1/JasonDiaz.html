      Let Me Introduce Myself...
    </h3>

    <p>
      Hello! My name is Jason Alexander Diaz, I am currently 19 years old (my birthday is in June). My pronouns are he/him, I am a heterosexual cis-male living in Southern California. <br>
      I am a latino with a mixture of Salvadoran and Mexican blood running in my veins. I have three older siblings, all brothers, whom I love very deeply. I have two pets, one dog and one cat who are both about a year old.
      My dog's name is Koda Fang, she is a sheepadoodle who loves to run around and play. My cat's name is Rocket Pyewacket, he's a siamese cat who loves to cause mischief.
