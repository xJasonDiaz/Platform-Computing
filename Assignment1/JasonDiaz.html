    <p>
      Hello! My name is Jason Alexander Diaz, I am currently 19 years old (my birthday is in June). My pronouns are he/him, I am a heterosexual cis-male living in Southern California.
      I am a latino with a mixture of Salvadoran and Mexican blood running in my veins. I have three older siblings, all brothers, whom I love very deeply. I have two pets, one dog and one cat who are both about a year old.
      My dog's name is Koda Fang, she is a sheepadoodle who loves to run around and play. My cat's name is Rocket Pyewacket, he's a siamese cat who loves to cause mischief.

      I am currently a full-time student at the California State University of San Bernardino (CSUSB). 
      I am in the second semester of my second year. I am a Computer Science major pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree. 
      An accomplishment I expect to attain by 2026. 
      I find my area of study to be quite enjoyable and am excited for the opportunities it presents. 
      I graduated with the class of 2022, receiving my diploma from Santiago High School.

      Hobbies...
    </h3>

    <p>
      Growing up I always enjoyed reading, everything from Pride and Prejudice to Percy Jackson, you'd rarely see me without a book in my hands.
      Nowadays, I still enjoy reading but spend most of my time either studying, playing videogames, or messing around with personal coding projects.

      I was never really into sports, AYSO soccer teams were as far as I went with organized sports.
      I do enjoy hiking and skateboarding however, activities I share with friends and family.
